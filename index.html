                A sprawling monster of a rock opera, The Wall is ripe with
                rewards for intrepid listeners; but those returning to Floyd
                after the curt critiques proffered by the 40-odd-minute Animals
                were surely dizzied by this double-length package. It’s great,
                don’t be mistaken; but trim a little of its fat and it goes from
                a fantastic listen to an unforgettable one. The Wall hides its
                treats away beneath multi-layered distractions, its makers
                reacting negatively to their newly acquired stadium-sized
                crowds.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Floyd didn’t lose its collective head – they used The Wall
                to tackle their huge audiences on terms that suited both
                parties, presenting a dramatic live show that brought the
                album’s conceptual framework – isolation and detachment from the
                perspective of one Floyd Pinkerton, whose lifelong travails
                inform the lyrical content – to vivid life. The show tours to
                this day, albeit under Waters’ name – but then he’s the sole
                writer on all but four tracks here.
